# FBG-SimPlus V1.0

Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) simulation tool for Finite Element Method (FEM) models. Features inclusion of temperature dependency and emulation within the program. The user can supply a data file and generate simulated reflection spectrums of an array of FBG sensors in response to:
* Longitudinal Strain (Uniform and Non-Uniform)
* Transverse Stress
* Temperature

### Considerations

Please email Ben Frey (freynben@gmail.com) with questions or with run-time issues.

Current known issues:
1. Instability when plotting spectral responses, sometimes leads to program crash.
2. Inability to exit from program on macOS, requires force quit.
3. Saving plot picture inconsistent functionality.
